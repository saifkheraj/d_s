## 1. What is a Probability Distribution Function (PDF)?

A **Probability Distribution Function** maps a **random variable** (an uncertain event) to the **likelihood of its outcomes**.

- ‚úÖ **Input**: Random variable (e.g., dice roll, height, time)
- ‚úÖ **Output**: Probability or probability density

### üé≤ Example:
Rolling a fair 6-sided die:  
Each number (1‚Äì6) has a probability of 1/6.

---

## 2. Types of Random Variables

| Type       | Description                   | Example                     | Related Function                 |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Discrete   | Finite/countable outcomes     | Die roll, coin toss         | PMF: Probability Mass Function   |
| Continuous | Infinite/uncountable outcomes | Height, weight, time        | PDF: Probability Density Function|

---

## 3. Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Used with **discrete variables** to assign probabilities to each individual outcome.

### üé≤ Example:
Rolling a fair die:
- Outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Probability: Each = 1/6 = 0.167
- Visual: Vertical bars of equal height (bar plot)

---

## 4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

**CDF** = Probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a value (**P(X ‚â§ x)**)

### üìä Discrete Case Example:
| Outcome | PMF   | CDF  |
|---------|-------|------|
| 1       | 0.10  | 0.10 |
| 2       | 0.20  | 0.30 |
| 3       | 0.30  | 0.60 |
| 4,5     | 0.00  | 0.60 |
| 6       | 0.40  | 1.00 |

- CDF is **non-decreasing**
- Max value = **1**

---

## 5. Continuous Probability Density Function (PDF)

Used with **continuous variables** like height or time.

### Key Concepts:
- `P(X = exact value)` = **0**
- Instead, calculate interval probabilities:  
  `P(57 < X < 63)` = **Area under the curve**
- **Total area under PDF = 1**

---

## 6. üîî Normal Distribution (with Excel & Real-World Example)

The **normal distribution**, or bell curve, is the most widely used continuous probability distribution in statistics, business, and science.

### üéØ Real-Life Example: Food Delivery Times

Imagine you're a data scientist working at a food delivery company. You collect delivery time data from 1,000 completed orders.

- Most deliveries take **around 30 minutes**
- Fewer deliveries take **very short (<10 min)** or **very long (>50 min)** times

When you plot a histogram of these delivery times, you notice a **symmetric, bell-shaped curve** forming ‚Äî this is a hallmark of the **normal distribution**.

### üìä Characteristics of the Normal Distribution

| Feature               | Description                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shape                | Bell-shaped, symmetric around the mean                     |
| Mean (Œº)             | Location of the center (peak of the curve)                |
| Standard Deviation (œÉ)| Spread of the curve ‚Äî wider means more variability        |
| Total Area           | Equals **1** under the curve (i.e., total probability)     |
| Tails                | Extend to ¬±‚àû but rapidly approach zero probability density |

### üìÉ Formula

```math
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
```

### üìò Excel Implementation

- Use `=NORM.DIST(x, mean, std_dev, FALSE)` for PDF
- Use `=NORM.DIST(x, mean, std_dev, TRUE)` for CDF

### ‚öô Changing Parameters

| Curve | Mean (Œº) | Std. Dev. (œÉ) | Shape Insight                        |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| A     | 30       | 5             | Centered at 30, moderately narrow    |
| B     | 30       | 10            | Same center, but wider               |
| C     | 40       | 5             | Shifted right                        |

### üõ° Confidence Interval (95%) in Excel

```excel
=NORM.INV(0.025, 30, 5)  // Lower Bound
=NORM.INV(0.975, 30, 5)  // Upper Bound
```

---

## 7. Interval Probability

For **continuous variables**:
```text
P(a < X < b) = CDF(b) - CDF(a)
```
This represents the **area under the PDF curve** between `a` and `b`.

## 8. Key Properties Summary

| Concept | Applies To | Description                             |
|---------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| PMF     | Discrete   | Probability of each outcome             |
| PDF     | Continuous | Density function (not exact probability)|
| CDF     | Both       | Cumulative probability ‚â§ x             |
| Area    | Continuous | Represents probability between values   |
| Total   | All        | Must always sum to 1                    |

## 9. üåü Comparing Distributions Using Stochastic Dominance

In simulation, we often compare different forecast distributions to decide which outcome is better.

### üèõ First-Order Stochastic Dominance (FSD)

- **Definition**: A's CDF is always **below or equal to** B's CDF
- **Preference**: All decision-makers prefer A (if A has higher return or lower cost)

### üìà Second-Order Stochastic Dominance (SSD)

- **Definition**: A's CDF **crosses once** from below and A has **lower risk** and **equal or better mean**
- **Preference**: Risk-averse people prefer A

### ‚ùå No Dominance

- CDFs cross multiple times, or trade-offs exist between mean and risk
- Use **utility functions** to decide

### üìÉ Summary Table

| Scenario        | Mean(Œº) | SD(œÉ) | CDF Crossing | Dominance Type | Who Prefers A?          |
|----------------|------------|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Higher Œº, Same œÉ | A > B      | Same     | Never          | FSD            | Everyone                 |
| Higher Œº, Lower œÉ| A > B      | Lower    | Cross Once     | SSD            | Risk-averse only         |
| Higher Œº, Higher œÉ| A > B      | Higher   | Multiple        | None           | Depends on risk profile  |
