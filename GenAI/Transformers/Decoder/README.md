1️⃣ What is Top-K Sampling?

🔹 "Keep the K most probable words and ignore the rest"

Instead of picking from all words, it only considers the top K most probable words at each step.

Example of Top-K Sampling

Imagine GPT-2 is generating text and needs to predict the next word after:
📝 "The food was"

The model gives probabilities for the next word:

Word	Probability

delicious	40%

amazing	30%

terrible	15%

overpriced	10%

blue	5%

dog	0.1%

spaceship	0.01%

🔹 Top-K with K=3 → Keep only the top 3 words: ✅ "delicious", "amazing", 
"terrible"

❌ "overpriced", "blue", "dog", "spaceship" (discarded)

👉 The model picks randomly among the top 3 words, making the text more diverse.


 2️⃣ What is Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)?
 
🔹 "Keep the smallest set of words whose probabilities sum to at least P"

Instead of choosing a fixed K, this method dynamically selects the top words until their combined probability reaches a threshold (e.g., 0.95 or 95%).
Example of Top-P Sampling (P = 0.95)

Using the same scenario ("The food was"), here are the probabilities of different words:

Word	Probability	Cumulative Probability

delicious	40%	40%

amazing	30%	70%

terrible	15%	85%

overpriced	10%	95% ✅ (Stop here)

blue	5%	100% ❌ (Ignored)

🔹 Top-P with P=0.95 → Keep words until total probability reaches 95%:

✅ "delicious", "amazing", "terrible", "overpriced"

❌ "blue", "dog", "spaceship" (discarded)

👉 Unlike Top-K, the number of words considered is not fixed!
👉 It varies depending on the probability distribution of the words.



Which method is better?

✅ Use Top-K when you want consistent word selection (e.g., K=50).

✅ Use Top-P when you want a flexible, probability-based approach (e.g., P=0.9).
