## Positional Encoding

Without positional encoding, the Transformer would treat the sentence "I like cats" the same as "cats like I", since it processes all tokens in parallel and lacks the sequential nature of RNNs. By adding positional encodings, the model can learn the relative or absolute position of tokens in a sequence, which is crucial for understanding language.
It uses sine and cosine functions to encode positions, ensuring that each position is uniquely represented.
Without positional encoding, Transformers would lose the ability to understand the sequence order.
Both fixed positional encoding and learned positional embeddings are used in practice, depending on the model architecture and task.

### Positional Encoding Explanation Using a Word Example
Let’s take a simple sentence:

"She loves cats"

The computer doesn’t know the order of the words, so we need positional encoding to tell it that:

"She" is the first word.

"loves" is the second word.

"cats" is the third word.

But instead of just saying first, second, and third, we use more complex position tags for each word. These tags are calculated using mathematical functions (sine and cosine), which give us different values for different positions.

#### Step-by-Step Example
Word Embedding: First, each word ("She", "loves", "cats") is converted into a vector (a list of numbers) using a word embedding like GloVe or Word2Vec.

Let’s say:

"She" becomes [0.5, 0.8, 0.1]

"loves" becomes [0.6, 0.9, 0.3]

"cats" becomes [0.4, 0.7, 0.2]

Positional Encoding: Now, we add positional tags to these word vectors to tell the model where each word is in the sentence.

Using sine and cosine functions, the positional encoding might give us values like:

Position tag for the 1st word ("She"): [0.0, 1.0, 0.5]

Position tag for the 2nd word ("loves"): [0.8, 0.5, 0.2]

Position tag for the 3rd word ("cats"): [0.9, 0.2, 0.1]

Adding Word Embedding + Positional Encoding: For each word, we add the word embedding and the positional encoding together:

"She": [0.5, 0.8, 0.1] + [0.0, 1.0, 0.5] = [0.5, 1.8, 0.6]

"loves": [0.6, 0.9, 0.3] + [0.8, 0.5, 0.2] = [1.4, 1.4, 0.5]

"cats": [0.4, 0.7, 0.2] + [0.9, 0.2, 0.1] = [1.3, 0.9, 0.3]

Now, each word not only has its meaning (from word embedding) but also its position in the sentence (from positional encoding).
