Let’s take a simple sentence:

"She loves cats"

The computer doesn’t know the order of the words, so we need positional encoding to tell it that:

"She" is the first word.
"loves" is the second word.
"cats" is the third word.
But instead of just saying first, second, and third, we use more complex position tags for each word. These tags are calculated using mathematical functions (sine and cosine), which give us different values for different positions.
