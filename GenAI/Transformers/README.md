## Positional Encoding

Without positional encoding, the Transformer would treat the sentence "I like cats" the same as "cats like I", since it processes all tokens in parallel and lacks the sequential nature of RNNs. By adding positional encodings, the model can learn the relative or absolute position of tokens in a sequence, which is crucial for understanding language.
It uses sine and cosine functions to encode positions, ensuring that each position is uniquely represented.
Without positional encoding, Transformers would lose the ability to understand the sequence order.
Both fixed positional encoding and learned positional embeddings are used in practice, depending on the model architecture and task.

### Positional Encoding Explanation Using a Word Example
Let’s take a simple sentence:

"She loves cats"

The computer doesn’t know the order of the words, so we need positional encoding to tell it that:

"She" is the first word.

"loves" is the second word.

"cats" is the third word.

But instead of just saying first, second, and third, we use more complex position tags for each word. These tags are calculated using mathematical functions (sine and cosine), which give us different values for different positions.

#### Step-by-Step Example
Word Embedding: First, each word ("She", "loves", "cats") is converted into a vector (a list of numbers) using a word embedding like GloVe or Word2Vec.

Let’s say:

"She" becomes [0.5, 0.8, 0.1]

"loves" becomes [0.6, 0.9, 0.3]

"cats" becomes [0.4, 0.7, 0.2]

Positional Encoding: Now, we add positional tags to these word vectors to tell the model where each word is in the sentence.

Using sine and cosine functions, the positional encoding might give us values like:

Position tag for the 1st word ("She"): [0.0, 1.0, 0.5]

Position tag for the 2nd word ("loves"): [0.8, 0.5, 0.2]

Position tag for the 3rd word ("cats"): [0.9, 0.2, 0.1]

Adding Word Embedding + Positional Encoding: For each word, we add the word embedding and the positional encoding together:

"She": [0.5, 0.8, 0.1] + [0.0, 1.0, 0.5] = [0.5, 1.8, 0.6]

"loves": [0.6, 0.9, 0.3] + [0.8, 0.5, 0.2] = [1.4, 1.4, 0.5]

"cats": [0.4, 0.7, 0.2] + [0.9, 0.2, 0.1] = [1.3, 0.9, 0.3]

Now, each word not only has its meaning (from word embedding) but also its position in the sentence (from positional encoding).

#### Why This Helps the Model?

If we change the order of the words:

"Cats love she"

Even though the words are the same, their positional encoding will be different, so the model will know it’s a different sentence because the position tags will have changed.

For example:

"Cats" will now have the position tag for the 1st word.

"Love" will have the position tag for the 2nd word.

"She" will have the position tag for the 3rd word.

This way, the model understands both the words and their correct order, which is crucial for tasks like language translation or text summarization.

Summary (in Simple Words)

 - Word embeddings tell the model what each word means.
 - Positional encoding tells the model where each word is in the sentence.
 - Together, they help the model understand both the meaning and order of the words, which is essential for processing natural language.

## Query Key and Value

### Identical Query and Key Vectors

In this simplified setup, query vectors (Q) are identical to key vectors (K).

Both the query vectors and key vectors are represented as one-hot encoded vectors:

A one-hot encoded vector is a vector where only one element is 1, and the rest are 0. Each word has a unique one-hot vector.
For example, the French word "chat" might be represented by the vector [1, 0, 0, 0], and the word "sous" by [0, 0, 1, 0].

#### Key Matrix
```
K = [
    [1, 0, 0, 0],  # "chat"
    [0, 1, 0, 0],  # "est"
    [0, 0, 1, 0]   # "sous"
]

```
Since the query vectors are identical to the key vectors, the query matrix (Q) will look the same as the key matrix.

#### Value Matrix (V)

The value vectors represent the English translations of the French words, also using one-hot encoded vectors.

The value vectors represent the English translations of the French words, also using one-hot encoded vectors.

Each row in the value matrix (V) corresponds to the one-hot encoded English word

```
V = [
    [1, 0, 0, 0],  # "cat"
    [0, 1, 0, 0],  # "is"
    [0, 0, 1, 0]   # "under"
]
```

####  Aligning Keys and Values

The key matrix K and the value matrix V are arranged so that the same row in both matrices corresponds to the same word pair (French-English translation).

For example:
 - The first row of K corresponds to "chat" and aligns with the first row of V, which corresponds to "cat".
 - The second row of K corresponds to "est" and aligns with the second row of V, which corresponds to "is".
 - The third row of K corresponds to "sous" and aligns with the third row of V, which corresponds to "under".


#### How Translation Works

Input the Query (French Word):

Suppose we want to translate the French word "sous".

The query vector for "sous" is [0, 0, 1, 0].

Compute the Dot Product:

The query vector is multiplied by the transposed key matrix (Kᵀ).

Since the vectors are one-hot encoded, the dot product will result in a vector where all elements are 0 except for the element corresponding to the matching key.

For "sous", the dot product will result in [0, 0, 1, 0], indicating that the third row is the relevant key.

Select the Corresponding Value:

The resulting vector is then multiplied by the value matrix (V).

Since only the third element is non-zero, the product will retrieve the third row of V, which is [0, 0, 1, 0].


This corresponds to the English word "under".

The above is a simple illustration of how attention works. In real-world applications, instead of using one-hot vectors, word embeddings are used, and the process involves additional steps like applying a softmax function to focus on the most relevant key-value pairs.
