You will explore how to effectively retrieve relevant information from a large dataset and then use a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model to generate precise answers to complex questions. By integrating tools such as the Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) and the GPT2 model for generation, this lab will equip you with the skills to build a sophisticated question-answering system that can find and synthesize information on-the-fly. Through hands-on coding exercises and implementations, you will gain practical experience in handling real-world NLP challenges, setting up a robust natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, and fine-tuning models to enhance their accuracy and relevance.\n"

The ```DPRContextEncoder``` encodes passages into dense vectors that capture their semantic meanings within a high-dimensional space. Applying t-SNE to these dense vectors allows you to reduce their dimensionality to two or three dimensions. This reduction creates a visual representation that preserves the relationships between passages, enabling you to explore clusters of similar passages and discern patterns that might otherwise remain hidden in the high-dimensional space. The resulting plots provide insights into how the model differentiates between different types of passages and reveal the inherent structure within the encoded data.\n"

This process leverages the LLM's ability to understand and manipulate language based on the specific inputs provided by the retrieval phase, enabling the generation of precise answers to complex questions.\n",

    "- **Model**: The GPT2 model, specifically configured for conditional text generation, excels in generating answers based on the context provided by the retrieval system. Its architecture supports complex, context-driven text generation tasks, making it ideal for applications like question answering, where nuanced and detailed responses are required.\n",

    "By integrating these models and tokenizers, the system is equipped to handle two critical tasks essential for effective question answering:\n",
    "- **Encoding user queries**: Utilizing the DPR question encoder and its tokenizer, user queries are transformed into a form that efficiently retrieves related information.\n",
    "- **Generating relevant answers**: The GPT2 model takes the retrieved information to generate responses that are not only relevant but also contextually rich.\n",
