### Serverless at Startups vs. Scale

Serverless architectures are highly valuable in early-stage environments due to:

- **Low initial traffic**
- **Rapid iteration and experimentation**
- **Minimal infrastructure overhead**

However, as systems grow, priorities shift. At larger scale, serverless can become less cost-effectiveâ€”especially when teams already have strong cloud provisioning expertise.

In past experience, the **primary concern at scale was latency**, as performance bottlenecks directly affect customer experience.
