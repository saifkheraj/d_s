## Complete Implementation Example

Here's the full code implementation that matches our simplified workflow:

### Step 1: Setup and Imports

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import YoutubeVideoSearchTool

# Initialize the YouTube search tool
search_tool = YoutubeVideoSearchTool()
```

### Step 2: Create Research Agent

```python
# Research Agent - Analyzes YouTube content
researcher = Agent(
    role="Video Content Researcher",
    goal="Extract key insights from YouTube videos for article creation",
    backstory="""You are an expert at analyzing video content and identifying 
    the most important points, themes, and takeaways that would be valuable 
    for creating engaging articles.""",
    tools=[search_tool],
    memory=True,

)
```

### Step 3: Create Writer Agent

```python
# Writer Agent - Creates articles based on research
writer = Agent(
    role="Tech Article Writer",
    goal="Transform research insights into compelling, well-structured articles",
    backstory="""You are a skilled technical writer who excels at taking 
    research findings and creating engaging, informative articles that 
    resonate with readers.""",
    tools=[search_tool],  # Can access for additional research if needed
    memory=True,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Step 4: Define Tasks

```python
# Research Task
research_task = Task(
    description="""
    Analyze the YouTube video at the provided URL and extract:
    - Main topics and key concepts
    - Important insights and takeaways  
    - Notable examples or case studies
    - Technical details worth highlighting
    
    Provide a comprehensive summary that will serve as the foundation 
    for article creation.
    """,
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="Detailed research summary with key points organized by topic"
)

# Writing Task with Human Feedback
writing_task = Task(
    description="""
    Using the research findings, create an engaging article that:
    - Has a compelling introduction and conclusion
    - Is well-structured with clear sections
    - Explains technical concepts in accessible language
    - Includes relevant examples from the research
    - Maintains reader engagement throughout
    """,
    agent=writer,
    expected_output="Complete article ready for publication",
    human_input=True  # Enable human feedback for refinement
)
```

### Step 5: Create and Run the Crew

```python
# Setup the crew
youtube_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential,  # Research first, then writing
    verbose=2
)

# Execute the workflow
def run_youtube_analysis(video_url):
    result = youtube_crew.kickoff(
        inputs={
            "video_url": video_url,
            "target_audience": "tech professionals and enthusiasts"
        }
    )
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your-video-id"
    final_article = run_youtube_analysis(video_url)
    print("Final Article:", final_article)
```

### Step 6: Human Feedback Integration

When `human_input=True` is enabled, the system will pause and prompt for feedback:

```python
# The system will automatically prompt:
# "Please provide feedback on the article draft:"
# 
# Example responses:
# - "Looks good, publish it!" (proceeds to final output)
# - "Make the introduction more engaging" (agent refines and asks again)
# - "Add more technical details in section 2" (agent revises specific parts)
```
