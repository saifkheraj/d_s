## Understanding LLMs as Distributions and Sampling

This guide explains how large language models (LLMs), such as transformers, work as **distributions** and how we can generate different outputs by sampling from them. We break it down step by step.

---

### 1. LLMs as Distributions

LLMs do not generate a fixed answer. They generate responses by **sampling** from a **probability distribution** over possible words, given an input query.

> Example:
> For the query: **"Which is the largest ocean?"**
> Possible outputs:

* "Pacific Ocean"
* "Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean."
* "Atlantic Ocean"

These are sampled from the distribution $Y \sim \pi(Y|X)$, where $\pi$ is the probability distribution (policy) conditioned on input $X$.

---

### 2. How Transformers Generate Words

LLMs generate text **one token at a time**:

1. **Tokenize** the input (e.g., "Which is the largest ocean?").
2. Pass tokens through transformer layers.
3. Get **logits** (scores) for each word.
4. Apply **softmax** to convert logits into probabilities.
5. Sample a word from these probabilities.

> Example:
> Softmax might produce:

* "Pacific" = 60%
* "Atlantic" = 25%
* "Indian" = 15%

A word is sampled from this distribution instead of choosing the max (argmax).

---

### 3. Time-based Word Generation (t → t+1)

Each word depends on the previous words:

* At **time t**, the current word affects the next word's probability.
* This process is **causal** — past tokens influence future tokens.

> Example:
> “Pacific” at time t might lead to:

* “Ocean is”
* “Ocean covers”

This generates sequences like:

* “Pacific Ocean is the…”
* “Atlantic Sea is not…”
* “Indian Ocean if you…”

#### 🔁 What If Multiple Words Are Generated at Time t?

If at **time `t`** the model generates **multiple possible next words** (like in beam search or sampling), then **each of those words becomes the start of a separate path**. Every generated word continues into its **own time `t+1`** with its own probability distribution.

> For example:
> At `t = 1`:

* "Pacific"
* "Atlantic"
* "Indian"

At `t = 2`, each path expands:

* "Pacific Ocean"
* "Atlantic Ocean"
* "Indian Ocean"

This allows exploration of **multiple future paths** in parallel.

---

### 4. Visualizing with Bar Graphs

Each time step has a **bar graph**:

* **X-axis** = vocabulary words
* **Y-axis** = softmax probability for each word

Words are **sampled** based on their heights in the bar graph.

---

### 5. Generation Parameters

You can influence how the LLM generates output using these settings:

#### a. Temperature ($\tau$)

Controls randomness in the softmax function:

* Low $\tau$: sharp/peaky distribution (less random)
* High $\tau$: flat/uniform distribution (more random)

> Example:

* $\tau = 1$: Normal behavior
* $\tau = 10$: Almost all tokens equally likely

#### b. Top-K Sampling

Limits selection to the top K highest-probability words.

* Keeps only K best tokens
* Re-normalizes their probabilities

#### c. Top-p Sampling (Nucleus Sampling)

Selects the **smallest** group of words whose cumulative probability ≥ p.

* Dynamically adapts number of tokens
* Balances quality and diversity

#### d. Beam Search

Keeps **multiple best sequences** (beams) at each step:

* Expands them all
* Chooses the best final result

More coherent, but less diverse.

#### e. Repetition Penalty

Reduces probability of repeating previous words.

* Avoids loops like: "The ocean is big. The ocean is big."

#### f. Min/Max Tokens

Controls the length of output:

* **Min tokens** = at least this many words
* **Max tokens** = cut off after this many words

### Final Note

The key idea is: **LLMs generate output by sampling from distributions**, not by selecting fixed outputs. You can customize the randomness and structure of generated sequences using parameters like temperature, top-k, and beam search.

## From Distributions to Policies in LLMs

This guide explains how language models (LLMs) can be understood and used as **policies** in the context of **reinforcement learning (RL)**, and how the concept of **rollouts** plays a role in generating diverse and effective responses.

---

### 1. What Is a Policy in Reinforcement Learning?

In reinforcement learning, a **policy** is a strategy or mapping that tells an **agent** what action to take, based on the current **state** of the environment.

> Formally:
> **Policy**: $\pi(a|s)$ — a distribution over actions $a$, given a state $s$.

Policies are **stochastic** in nature — they rely on **probabilities**, allowing for exploration of **different action paths**.

---

### 2. Policies in Language Models (LLMs)

In LLMs, we can treat text generation as a **decision-making task** — where each word (token) is an action.

* A **policy** in this case is a distribution over the next word, given the previous sequence.
* Policies enable models to generate diverse, creative, and contextually rich outputs.

> Example:
> For the query: **"Which is the largest ocean?"**, possible completions:

* "Pacific Ocean"
* "The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean."
* "Atlantic Ocean"

These completions are sampled from a **policy distribution** $\pi(y|x)$, where:

* $x$: input query
* $y$: output sequence

---

### 3. Policy as a Function of Omega

The model follows the distribution:

$y \sim \pi(y|x) = \pi(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n|x_1, ..., x_m)$

This distribution is **factorized over time** — each token’s probability depends on prior tokens and is represented as a function of $\omega$ (the random seed or sampling process).

> For instance, to compute the probability of generating:
> **"Atlantic"**

* The model considers the query "Which is the largest ocean"
* Then evaluates: $\pi(\text{Atlantic}|x_1, x_2, ..., x_m)$

---

### 4. What Are Rollouts?

**Rollouts** refer to multiple **sampled responses** from the same query.

Each rollout is a **possible realization** from the model's policy:

> For the query **"Which is the largest ocean?"**, rollouts could include:

* Rollout 1: "Pacific Ocean"
* Rollout 2: "The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on Earth."
* Rollout 3: "Atlantic Ocean is 155 million square kilometers."

These are all **valid completions**, sampled from the same underlying policy.

---

### 5. Rollouts vs Hugging Face Definitions

In **RL**, a rollout usually includes **states, actions, and rewards**.
In **Hugging Face** and **LLM contexts**, rollout refers to:

* Sampling multiple completions (no rewards involved by default)
* Useful for tasks like summarization, code generation, etc.

> Example:
> Query: **"Can you give me some Python code?"**
> Rollouts:

* `print("Hello World")`
* `for i in range(5): print(i)`
* `def greet(): print("Hi!")`

Each is a separate **rollout**.

| Concept          | Description                                     |                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Policy (RL)      | Strategy for choosing actions based on state    |                                 |
| Policy (LLMs)    | Distribution over next tokens, given input      |                                 |
| Policy Notation  | ( y \sim \pi(y                                  | x) ) — Output from distribution |
| Omega ($\omega$) | Underlying random seed guiding generation       |                                 |
| Rollouts (LLMs)  | Different sampled responses from the same query |                                 |
| Rollouts (RL)    | Includes state, action, reward tuples           |                                 |

---

### Final Note

In this framework, LLMs operate **like RL agents**:

* **Policies** guide which tokens to generate.
* **Rollouts** are diverse realizations of output sequences.

Understanding this helps you apply **reinforcement-style thinking** to language modeling — optimizing responses, exploring diverse outputs, and eventually using rewards (e.g., human feedback) to **fine-tune the policy**.
