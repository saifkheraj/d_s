Instruction Tuning Overview
Introduction
This repository provides an overview of Instruction Tuning (also known as Supervised Fine-Tuning or SFT), a critical process for enhancing the performance of pre-trained language models. Instruction tuning trains models on expert-curated datasets containing instructions, inputs (optional), and outputs to improve task-specific accuracy and reliability. This document summarizes the process, components, special symbols, and instruction masking techniques involved in instruction tuning.
What is Instruction Tuning?
Instruction tuning is a fine-tuning method that improves a model's ability to follow specific instructions and generate accurate outputs. It is typically applied after pre-training and before advanced optimization techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Purpose: Aligns the model with human-like task execution.
Key Benefit: Enables models to handle diverse tasks such as question answering, text generation, translation, and code writing.

Training Process
The training of a GPT-like model involves three main stages:

Pre-Training: The model learns general language patterns by predicting the next word in a sequence using a large corpus of text.
Instruction Tuning: The model is fine-tuned on expert-labeled datasets with instructions, inputs (optional), and outputs.
RLHF/DPO: Further optimization aligns the model with human preferences or specific objectives.

Components of Instruction Tuning
Instruction tuning datasets consist of three components:

Instructions: Commands that define the task (e.g., "Answer the question" or "Write a Python function").
Input (optional): Contextual data required for the task (e.g., a question like "Which is the largest ocean?").
Output: The expected result (e.g., "The Pacific Ocean").

The model is trained to generate the entire sequence (instruction + input + output) as a single unit.
Special Symbols in Instruction Tuning
Special symbols (or tokens) are used to structure the input and output, ensuring the model correctly interprets the sequence. Examples include:

###instruction###: Marks the start of the instruction.
###response###: Marks the start of the output.
###human### and ###assistant###: Used in some datasets to denote human input and assistant response.

These tokens must align with the model's tokenizer to ensure compatibility. For example:
###instruction### Which is the largest ocean? ###response### The Pacific Ocean ###

Instruction Masking
Instruction masking focuses the loss calculation on specific output tokens, ignoring instructions and special tokens. This improves efficiency and ensures the model prioritizes learning the correct response.

How It Works: The loss (e.g., cross-entropy) is computed only for output tokens (e.g., "The Pacific Ocean") in the shifted sequence, masking tokens like ###instruction###.
Considerations:
Unmasked instructions may improve performance for smaller datasets.
Libraries like Hugging Face's transformers provide tools like DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM to configure masking.



Example
Task: Train a model to answer "Which is the largest ocean?"Dataset Entry:
###instruction### Answer the question: Which is the largest ocean? ###response### The Pacific Ocean ###

Training: The model learns to predict the output tokens ("The Pacific Ocean ###") while masking the instruction tokens.
Key Takeaways

Instruction tuning enhances a model's ability to interpret and execute tasks accurately.
Special tokens ensure structured data processing.
Instruction masking optimizes learning by focusing on critical output tokens.
Prompt formats must align with the model's tokenizer for compatibility.
