        "LangChain is an open-source framework uniquely designed to empower the development of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs). It stands out by providing essential tools and abstractions that enhance the customization, accuracy, and relevance of the information generated by these models.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, LangChain offers a generic interface compatible with nearly any LLM. This facilitates a centralized development environment where data scientists can seamlessly integrate LLM applications with various external data sources and software workflows. This integration is crucial for those looking to harness the full potential of AI in their processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most powerful features of LangChain is its module-based approach. This approach allows flexibility in performing experiments and optimizations of interactions with LLMs. Data scientists can dynamically compare prompts and switch between foundation models without significant code modifications. This saves valuable development time and enhances the ability to fine-tune applications to meet specific needs.\n"

        "📌 What Are We Trying to Do?\n",
        "We want to ask the model:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Tell me a joke.”\n",
        "\n",
        "…but instead of a random sentence, we want the result in this format:\n",
        "\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"setup\": \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\",\n",
        "  \"punchline\": \"To get to the other side!\"\n",

        "📦 What Is Pydantic?\n",
        "Pydantic is a Python tool used to define data structures. You can think of it like creating a template or a form that the model must fill in correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ In our case:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Joke(BaseModel):\n",
        "\n",
        "    setup: str  # The joke question\n",
        "    punchline: str  # The punchline or answer\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This says: “I want an object that has:\n",
        "\n",
        "a setup (as a string)\n",
        "\n",
        "a punchline (also a string)”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " - First, we want to ask a language model like ChatGPT to give us a joke, but instead of getting plain text, we want the response to follow a specific structure — something like a dictionary with two fields: setup (the question) and punchline (the answer). This is useful when we want structured, predictable output that can be used in applications or stored in databases.\n",
        "\n",
        " - To define this expected structure, we use a Python tool called Pydantic. It lets us create a model called Joke with two string fields: setup and punchline. Think of it like creating a form where the model must fill in the blanks correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Then, we use LangChain’s JsonOutputParser, which generates special instructions telling the model: “Please format your answer as JSON that fits the Joke structure.” These formatting instructions are generated automatically by calling output_parser.get_format_instructions().\n",
        "\n",
        " - Next, we build a prompt template using LangChain’s PromptTemplate. This combines three things: the task (\"Answer the user query\"), the format instructions (from the parser), and the actual user question (e.g., \"Tell me a joke\").\n",
        "\n",
        " - We also initialize the ChatOpenAI model, which is the actual GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 model that generates the response based on the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        " - After that, we chain everything together using LangChain’s chaining syntax (prompt | llm | output_parser). This means: take the prompt, send it to the model, then parse the response into a structured Joke object.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Finally, we invoke the chain using chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke\"}). The result is not just plain text, but a well-structured Python object like Joke(setup=\"Why did the...\", punchline=\"Because...\").\n",

An AIMessage illustration  \\nC. Prompt Template  \\nPrompt templates  [10] allow you to structure  input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the  desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs.  \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain  are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate.  \\nD. Chain  \\nChains  [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various u se cases and \\nrequirements.  Here are some advantages of using chains:  \\n• Modularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex tasks into smaller, manageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application.  \\n• Simplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher -level interface for developers.  \\n• Debugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, chains can help pinpoint the \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior . \\n• Maintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer.  \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model.  \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory  [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain.  We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain.  \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieve d from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice.  \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic . \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs.  \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are:  \\n1. How state is stored ?  \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in -\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module.  \\n2. How state is queried  ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats . \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only retur n information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run.  \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• ConversationBufferMemory  allows for saving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable.  \\n• ConversationBufferWindowMemory  keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the  last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large . \\nThe MindGuide chatbot  uses conversation buffer memory.  \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable.  \\nIII. ARCHITETURE  \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport.  The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing Welcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express y ourself. Let\\'s \\nbegin when you\\'re ready .')"

        "\n",

        "At a high level, text splitters work as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
        "2. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\n",
        "3. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).\n",
