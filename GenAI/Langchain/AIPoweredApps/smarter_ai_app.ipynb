    "LangChain is an open-source framework uniquely designed to empower the development of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs). It stands out by providing essential tools and abstractions that enhance the customization, accuracy, and relevance of the information generated by these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, LangChain offers a generic interface compatible with nearly any LLM. This facilitates a centralized development environment where data scientists can seamlessly integrate LLM applications with various external data sources and software workflows. This integration is crucial for those looking to harness the full potential of AI in their processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of LangChain is its module-based approach. This approach allows flexibility in performing experiments and optimizations of interactions with LLMs. Data scientists can dynamically compare prompts and switch between foundation models without significant code modifications. This saves valuable development time and enhances the ability to fine-tune applications to meet specific needs.\n"

    "This guide explains how to ask ChatGPT (via LangChain) to return responses in a structured format using a tool called Pydantic and a LangChain feature called JsonOutputParser.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 What Are We Trying to Do?\n",
    "We want to ask the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Tell me a joke.”\n",
    "\n",
    "…but instead of a random sentence, we want the result in this format:\n",
    "\n",

    "  \"punchline\": \"To get to the other side!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 What Is Pydantic?\n",
    "Pydantic is a Python tool used to define data structures. You can think of it like creating a template or a form that the model must fill in correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ In our case:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Joke(BaseModel):\n",
    "\n",
    "    setup: str  # The joke question\n",
    "    punchline: str  # The punchline or answer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This says: “I want an object that has:\n",
    "\n",
    "a setup (as a string)\n",
    "\n",
    "a punchline (also a string)”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - First, we want to ask a language model like ChatGPT to give us a joke, but instead of getting plain text, we want the response to follow a specific structure — something like a dictionary with two fields: setup (the question) and punchline (the answer). This is useful when we want structured, predictable output that can be used in applications or stored in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    " - To define this expected structure, we use a Python tool called Pydantic. It lets us create a model called Joke with two string fields: setup and punchline. Think of it like creating a form where the model must fill in the blanks correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Then, we use LangChain’s JsonOutputParser, which generates special instructions telling the model: “Please format your answer as JSON that fits the Joke structure.” These formatting instructions are generated automatically by calling output_parser.get_format_instructions().\n",
    "\n",
    " - Next, we build a prompt template using LangChain’s PromptTemplate. This combines three things: the task (\"Answer the user query\"), the format instructions (from the parser), and the actual user question (e.g., \"Tell me a joke\").\n",
    "\n",
    " - We also initialize the ChatOpenAI model, which is the actual GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 model that generates the response based on the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    " - After that, we chain everything together using LangChain’s chaining syntax (prompt | llm | output_parser). This means: take the prompt, send it to the model, then parse the response into a structured Joke object.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Finally, we invoke the chain using chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke\"}). The result is not just plain text, but a well-structured Python object like Joke(setup=\"Why did the...\", punchline=\"Because...\").\n",
