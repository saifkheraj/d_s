# LangChain Overview

## 1. Introduction

LangChain provides an environment to build and integrate large language model (LLM) applications with external data sources and workflows. It simplifies connecting models like GPT-4 into natural language processing (NLP) solutions for developers.


## 2. Core Components

* **Chains:** A sequence of calls where each step’s output feeds the next.
* **Agents:** Dynamic systems that determine and sequence actions, orchestrating chains and tool use.
* **Retrievers:** Modules that fetch relevant data segments for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
* **LangChain-Core vs. LangChain-Community:** Core provides foundational tools; Community extends functionality with integrations and examples.

## 3. Generative Models

Generative models learn data distributions to produce new content. Applications include text, images, music generation, data augmentation, drug discovery, and anomaly detection.

**Types of Generative Models:**

* Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
* Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
* Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Diffusion Models

## 4. Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering crafts inputs to guide LLMs effectively. It comprises four elements:

1. **Instructions** – Task definition.
2. **Context** – Background information.
3. **Input Data** – Variables or examples.
4. **Output Indicator** – Desired format or response type.

**Advantages:**

* Improves accuracy and relevance.
* Aligns responses with user expectations.
* Reduces the need for continual model fine-tuning.

**Advanced Techniques:**

* Zero-shot prompting
* Few-shot prompting
* Chain-of-thought prompting
* Self-consistency

## 5. Prompt Templates & Output Parsing

* **Prompt Templates:** Predefined recipes that standardize prompt construction.
* **Output Parsers:** Convert raw LLM text output into structured formats.

## 6. Document Handling for RAG

* **Document Objects:** Containers holding `page_content` and `metadata`.
* **Loaders:** Import and split various document types (HTML, PDF, code).
* **Embeddings & Retrievers:** Vectorize and query document segments for RAG pipelines.

## 7. Chains & Memory

* **LLMChain:** Combines `PromptTemplate` with an LLM for stepwise execution.
* **Memory Storage:** Persists past interactions to maintain conversational context.

## 8. Agents & Tool Integrations

Agents in LangChain can call external tools (search engines, databases, APIs) based on LLM reasoning, enabling complex, multi-step workflows. Agents handle messages such as `HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage`, `FunctionMessage`, and `ToolMessage` to achieve tasks dynamically.
