        "Imagine you are working on a project that involves processing a large collection of text documents, such as research papers, legal documents, or customer service logs. Your task is to develop a system that can quickly retrieve the most relevant segments of text based on a user's query. Traditional keyword-based search methods might not be sufficient, as they often fail to capture the nuanced meanings and contexts within the documents. To address this challenge, you can use different types of retrievers based on LangChain.\n",

        "Using retrievers is crucial for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Efficiency: Retrievers enable fast and efficient retrieval of relevant information from large datasets, saving time and computational resources.\n",
        "- Accuracy: By leveraging advanced retrieval techniques, these tools can provide more accurate and contextually relevant results compared to traditional search methods.\n",
        "- Versatility: Different retrievers can be tailored to specific use cases, making them adaptable to various types of text data and query requirements.\n",
        "- Context awareness: Some retrievers, like the Parent Document Retriever, can consider the broader context of the document, enhancing the relevance of the retrieved segments.\n"
