# Routing with LLM-Based Classifiers

## Overview

Routing with LLM-based classifiers is a dynamic approach to directing user queries in multi-domain applications. Instead of relying on hardcoded rules or semantic similarity calculations, this method uses a Large Language Model itself as an intelligent classifier to analyze and categorize incoming queries. The classified query is then routed to a specialized prompt or sub-model designed for that specific domain.

This approach treats classification as a natural language understanding task, leveraging the LLM's inherent ability to comprehend context, intent, and nuanced meaning in user queries.

## Intuition: How It Works

Imagine a sophisticated customer service system where the first representative you speak with doesn't handle your request directly. Instead, their sole job is to *understand* your problem and transfer you to the right department. They listen carefully, ask clarifying questions if needed, and use their judgment to decide whether you need sales, technical support, billing, or another department.

LLM-based classifier routing works similarly:

1. **The Query Arrives**: A user submits a question or request
2. **The Classifier Analyzes**: A dedicated LLM examines the query's content, context, and intent
3. **Classification Decision**: The LLM determines which category best fits the query (e.g., "Personal Finance", "Health & Fitness")
4. **Routing Execution**: Based on the classification, the system selects the appropriate specialized prompt
5. **Response Generation**: The main LLM uses the selected domain-specific prompt to generate a tailored response

The key difference from semantic routing: instead of comparing numerical embeddings, we're asking an LLM to make an intelligent judgment call about what the query is really asking for.

## How LLM-Based Classifier Routing Works: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Define Domain-Specific Templates
Create specialized prompts for each domain you want to support, just like in semantic routing.

```python
personal_finance_template = """You are a financial advisor specializing in personal finance...
Question: {question}"""

book_review_template = """You are an expert literary critic...
Question: {question}"""

health_fitness_template = """You are a certified health and fitness expert...
Question: {question}"""

travel_guide_template = """You are an experienced travel consultant...
Question: {question}"""
```

### Step 2: Create a Classification Template
Design a prompt that instructs the classifier LLM to categorize user queries.

```python
classification_template = """You are good at classifying a question.
Given the user question below, classify it into one of the following categories:

<If the question is related to personal finance, investing, budgeting, or money management>
Personal Finance
</If>

<If the question is related to book reviews, literary analysis, or reading recommendations>
Book Review
</If>

<If the question is related to health, fitness, exercise, or wellness>
Health and Fitness
</If>

<If the question is related to travel destinations, tourism, or vacation planning>
Travel Guide
</If>

Question: {question}

Classification:"""
```

### Step 3: Build the Classification Chain
Create a processing pipeline that sends the query through the classifier LLM.

```python
classification_chain = (
    classification_template 
    | ChatOpenAI() 
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

This chain:
- Takes the classification template with the user's query
- Sends it to the OpenAI API
- Parses the LLM's response into a clean string (the category name)

### Step 4: Implement the Router Function
Create a function that uses the classification chain to select the appropriate template.

```python
def prompt_router(input_query):
    """Route user query to appropriate LLM template based on classification."""
    question = input_query["question"]
    
    # Get classification from the LLM
    classification = classification_chain.invoke({"question": question})
    
    # Route based on classification
    if "personal finance" in classification.lower():
        print("Using PERSONAL FINANCE")
        return personal_finance_template
    elif "book review" in classification.lower():
        print("Using BOOK REVIEW")
        return book_review_template
    elif "health and fitness" in classification.lower():
        print("Using HEALTH AND FITNESS")
        return health_fitness_template
    elif "travel guide" in classification.lower():
        print("Using TRAVEL GUIDE")
        return travel_guide_template
    else:
        print(f"Unexpected classification: {classification}")
        return None
```

### Step 5: Process User Queries
Use the router function to handle incoming queries.

```python
# Define user query
input_query = {"question": "What are the best ways to lose weight?"}

# Get appropriate template
prompt = prompt_router(input_query)

# If valid template found, generate response
if prompt:
    chain = (
        {"question": RunnablePassthrough()} 
        | prompt 
        | ChatOpenAI() 
        | StrOutputParser()
    )
    response = chain.invoke(input_query["question"])
    print(response)
else:
    print("Error: Could not determine appropriate category for the query")
```

### Step 6: Handle Edge Cases
Implement error handling for queries that don't fit any category.

```python
if prompt is None:
    # Fallback to generic template or request clarification
    fallback_response = "I'm not sure which category your question fits. 
                        Could you please rephrase or provide more context?"
```

## Advantages

### 1. **Natural Language Understanding**
The classifier can understand context, nuance, and intent rather than just keyword matching or semantic similarity.

### 2. **Flexible Classification Logic**
Can handle complex classification rules including negations, compound queries, and contextual interpretations.

### 3. **No Training Data Required**
Unlike traditional ML classifiers, you don't need to collect and label training data—just write clear classification instructions.

### 4. **Easy to Update and Maintain**
Adding new categories or modifying classification rules is as simple as updating the prompt template.

### 5. **Handles Ambiguity Better**
The LLM can reason about ambiguous queries and make informed decisions based on context.

### 6. **Explainable Decisions**
You can ask the LLM to explain its classification, providing transparency in routing decisions.

### 7. **Multi-Criteria Classification**
Can consider multiple factors simultaneously (topic, sentiment, urgency, user intent) when classifying.

### 8. **No Embedding Overhead**
Doesn't require maintaining and calculating embeddings for representative questions.

## Disadvantages

### 1. **Higher Latency**
Requires an additional LLM call before the main query can be processed, adding significant latency (typically 1-3 seconds).

### 2. **Increased API Costs**
Every query requires two LLM calls: one for classification, one for response generation, doubling the API costs.

### 3. **Non-Deterministic Behavior**
LLM classifications may vary slightly for the same query across multiple runs, leading to inconsistent routing.

### 4. **Potential Classification Errors**
The classifier LLM can misunderstand queries or make incorrect categorization decisions.

### 5. **Token Usage for Classification**
The classification prompt consumes input tokens, and complex classification logic requires longer prompts.

### 6. **Dependency on LLM Quality**
Classification accuracy depends entirely on the LLM's capabilities and the quality of classification instructions.

### 7. **Harder to Debug**
Unlike rule-based or similarity-based systems, it's harder to predict or debug why a specific classification was made.

### 8. **Prompt Engineering Complexity**
Requires careful crafting of classification prompts to ensure consistent and accurate categorization.

## Practical Tips

### Design Effective Classification Prompts

**Be Explicit and Specific**
```python
# ❌ Bad: Vague categories
"If it's about money -> Finance"

# ✅ Good: Clear criteria
"If the question relates to personal budgeting, investing, retirement planning,
debt management, savings strategies, or financial goal setting -> Personal Finance"
```

**Use Examples in Classification Prompt**
```python
classification_template = """Classify the user's question into one of these categories:

Personal Finance - Examples: "How should I save for retirement?", "Best investment strategy?"
Book Review - Examples: "What did critics think of '1984'?", "Recommend books like Harry Potter"
...

Question: {question}
Classification:"""
```

**Handle Edge Cases Explicitly**
```python
classification_template = """...
<If the question spans multiple categories, choose the PRIMARY focus>
<If the question doesn't clearly fit any category, respond with "GENERAL">
<If the question is too vague or unclear, respond with "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED">
..."""
```

### Optimize for Performance and Cost

**Use Faster Models for Classification**
```python
# Use a smaller, faster model for classification
classification_chain = (
    classification_template 
    | ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)  # Faster, cheaper
    | StrOutputParser()
)

# Use more powerful model for response generation
response_chain = (
    prompt 
    | ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)  # Better quality
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

**Set Temperature to 0 for Consistency**
```python
ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)  # More deterministic classifications
```

**Implement Caching**
```python
# Cache classifications for frequently asked questions
classification_cache = {}

def cached_classification(question):
    if question in classification_cache:
        return classification_cache[question]
    
    result = classification_chain.invoke({"question": question})
    classification_cache[question] = result
    return result
```

### Improve Classification Accuracy

**Use Structured Output**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class QueryClassification(BaseModel):
    category: str
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str

# Request structured output from the LLM
classification_template = """Classify the query and respond in JSON format:
{
  "category": "Personal Finance",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Query asks about investment strategies"
}
..."""
```

**Implement Confidence Thresholds**
```python
def prompt_router(input_query):
    classification_result = classification_chain.invoke(input_query)
    
    # Parse confidence from structured output
    if classification_result["confidence"] < 0.7:
        return generic_fallback_template  # Low confidence, use general template
    
    return select_template(classification_result["category"])
```

**Add Validation Logic**
```python
def prompt_router(input_query):
    classification = classification_chain.invoke(input_query)
    
    valid_categories = ["Personal Finance", "Book Review", "Health and Fitness", "Travel Guide"]
    
    # Check if classification is valid
    if not any(cat.lower() in classification.lower() for cat in valid_categories):
        # Re-classify with more specific prompt or use fallback
        return fallback_template
    
    return select_template(classification)
```

### Monitor and Improve Over Time

**Log All Classifications**
```python
def prompt_router(input_query):
    classification = classification_chain.invoke(input_query)
    
    # Log for analysis
    log_classification(
        query=input_query["question"],
        classification=classification,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )
    
    return select_template(classification)
```

**Analyze Misclassifications**
```python
# Periodically review logs to find patterns
# Questions that consistently get wrong template
# Update classification prompt based on findings
```

**A/B Test Classification Prompts**
```python
def prompt_router_v1(input_query):
    # Original classification logic
    ...

def prompt_router_v2(input_query):
    # Improved classification logic
    ...

# Randomly route users to different versions and track performance
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

**Graceful Degradation**
```python
def prompt_router(input_query):
    try:
        classification = classification_chain.invoke(input_query)
        return select_template(classification)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)
        return generic_fallback_template  # Always have a fallback
```

**Retry Logic for API Failures**
```python
def classify_with_retry(query, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return classification_chain.invoke({"question": query})
        except APIError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

**User Feedback Loop**
```python
# After generating response, ask for confirmation
response = chain.invoke(input_query)
print(response)
print("\nWas this response helpful? (y/n)")

# Use feedback to improve classification prompt
if feedback == 'n':
    log_misclassification(input_query, classification)
```

### Advanced Techniques

**Multi-Level Classification**
```python
# First level: Broad category
primary_classification = primary_classifier.invoke(query)

# Second level: Specific sub-category
if primary_classification == "Finance":
    sub_classification = finance_sub_classifier.invoke(query)
    # Route to: investing, budgeting, tax planning, etc.
```

**Hybrid Approach**
```python
# Combine with semantic routing for best of both worlds
def hybrid_router(input_query):
    # Quick semantic check first
    semantic_score = calculate_semantic_similarity(input_query)
    
    if semantic_score > 0.9:
        return semantic_route(input_query)  # High confidence, skip LLM
    else:
        return llm_classify(input_query)  # Uncertain, use LLM
```

**Chain of Thought Classification**
```python
classification_template = """Analyze the question step by step:
1. What is the main topic?
2. What is the user's intent?
3. Which domain expert would best answer this?

Question: {question}

Step-by-step analysis:"""
```

## Comparison: LLM-Based vs Semantic Routing

| Aspect | LLM-Based Classifier | Semantic Routing |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Latency** | Higher (extra LLM call) | Lower (similarity calculation) |
| **Cost** | Higher (2 LLM calls) | Lower (1 LLM call + embeddings) |
| **Accuracy** | Better for nuanced queries | Better for straightforward queries |
| **Setup** | Simpler (just write prompts) | More complex (define questions) |
| **Maintenance** | Easy (update prompt) | Moderate (update question sets) |
| **Consistency** | Less consistent | More consistent |
| **Explainability** | Can request explanations | Similarity scores |
| **Handling Ambiguity** | Excellent | Good |

## When to Use LLM-Based Classifier Routing

**Ideal for:**
- Applications where accuracy is more important than speed
- Complex domains with nuanced differences
- Scenarios requiring contextual understanding
- Systems that need to adapt quickly to new categories
- Applications with sufficient budget for dual LLM calls
- Projects where latency of 2-4 seconds is acceptable

**Not ideal for:**
- Real-time, latency-critical applications (< 1 second response time)
- High-volume systems with tight budget constraints
- Simple categorization tasks (use semantic routing instead)
- Applications requiring deterministic, reproducible routing
- Systems with unstable or unreliable LLM API access

## Migration Strategy: From Semantic to LLM-Based Routing

If you're currently using semantic routing and considering LLM-based classification:

1. **Start with A/B Testing**: Route 10% of traffic through LLM classifier
2. **Compare Metrics**: Measure accuracy, latency, cost, user satisfaction
3. **Identify Sweet Spots**: Some queries benefit from LLM, others don't
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use semantic for simple queries, LLM for complex ones
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Incrementally increase LLM routing percentage

## Conclusion

LLM-based classifier routing offers a powerful, flexible approach to query routing in multi-domain applications. While it comes with higher latency and cost, its ability to understand context, handle ambiguity, and adapt to new categories makes it invaluable for complex use cases.

The key is balancing accuracy needs with performance and cost constraints. For many applications, a hybrid approach combining semantic routing for straightforward queries and LLM-based classification for complex ones offers the best of both worlds.

Start with clear classification prompts, monitor performance closely, and iterate based on real-world usage patterns to build a robust routing system that truly understands your users' needs.
