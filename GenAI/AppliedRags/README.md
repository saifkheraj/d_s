# Introduction to Vector Databases for Storing Embeddings

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to store embeddings using a vector database, specifically focusing on **Chroma DB**, an open-source vector store supported by **LangChain**. It covers the process of storing, retrieving, and performing similarity search operations on vector embeddings to enable efficient and relevant information retrieval.

---

## Why Use a Vector Database?

When working with unstructured data like text, images, or audio, embeddings are used to represent this data as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic relationships, making it easier to search and retrieve related content. However, traditional databases (e.g., SQL) are not optimized for handling such data. Vector databases solve this problem by:

* Storing high-dimensional vectors efficiently
* Indexing embeddings for fast retrieval
* Enabling similarity-based search

This makes them ideal for applications like semantic search, recommendation engines, question answering, and more.

---

## What is Chroma DB?

**Chroma DB** is an open-source vector store built to work seamlessly with LangChain. Its key features include:

* Efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings
* Support for metadata attached to each vector
* Seamless integration with LangChain's language model ecosystem
* Ideal for building semantic search engines and memory components for LLMs

---

## Setting Up Chroma DB with LangChain

To store embeddings in Chroma DB, you must first:

1. **Load and split** your target data into smaller chunks
2. **Generate embeddings** for each chunk using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, IBM WatsonX)

Then, you can construct the Chroma DB store:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

# Assume `documents` is a list of text chunks
# Assume `embedding_model` is an instance of a model with an embed_documents method

vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding_model)
```

Chroma DB will automatically:

* Embed each document
* Store both the embeddings and associated metadata
* Prepare for similarity search

---

## Performing a Similarity Search

Once the embeddings are stored, you can perform a similarity search on the vector database. Here’s how the process works:

1. **Input Query**: User provides a natural language query
2. **Query Embedding**: The embedding model converts the query to a high-dimensional vector
3. **Similarity Matching**: Chroma DB compares the query vector with stored vectors using distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance)
4. **Return Results**: Top-N most similar documents are returned

### Sample Code

```python
query = "What is the company’s email policy?"
results = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=4)

for result in results:
    print(result.page_content)  # Or result.metadata if needed
```

By default, Chroma returns the top 4 most relevant results (`k=4`), but you can modify this as needed.

---

## Key Benefits

* **Accuracy**: Semantic similarity captures meaning better than keyword search
* **Speed**: Fast retrieval using vector indices
* **Scalability**: Efficient for large-scale unstructured datasets

---

## Summary

* Vector embeddings convert unstructured data into numerical vectors for downstream tasks
* A vector database like Chroma DB stores these embeddings and enables similarity-based search
* Chroma DB integrates smoothly with LangChain, making embedding storage and retrieval seamless
* The similarity search process involves embedding the query and finding nearest neighbors in vector space

Using Chroma DB, developers can build powerful, intelligent applications that retrieve relevant information efficiently and accurately.

# 📘 LangChain Advanced Retrievers - Part 1: Vector Store-Based Retriever

## 🔍 What is a LangChain Retriever?

A **LangChain Retriever** is a core interface used to fetch relevant documents (or their chunks) based on a **free-form, unstructured query**.

Unlike a vector store, a retriever does **not necessarily store** the documents — it simply focuses on **returning relevant content**. You give it a query string, and it returns a list of documents or chunks related to that query.

This abstraction allows LangChain to support **multiple types of retrievers**, including those based on vector similarity, keyword search, hybrid retrieval, and more.

---

## 🧠 Vector Store-Based Retriever: Simplest Type

### 🔗 How It Works

The **Vector Store-Based Retriever** relies on a **vector database** that stores documents in **embedded form**. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Load documents** into LangChain.
2. **Split** documents into chunks (e.g., 500-word segments).
3. **Embed** each chunk using a text embedding model (like OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).
4. Store the embedded chunks in a **vector database** (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone).

Now, when a user provides a query:

* The query is **embedded** using the same embedding model.
* LangChain searches the vector store for **similar embeddings**.
* The top `k` most similar chunks are returned as results.

### 📌 Example:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

# Step 1: Load documents
loader = TextLoader("docs/email_policy.txt")
documents = loader.load()

# Step 2-3: Embed and store into FAISS
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embedding)

# Step 4: Create retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

# Step 5: Query the retriever
query = "What is the company's email policy?"
results = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
for doc in results:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

---

## 🔁 Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)

MMR enhances retrieval by **balancing relevance and diversity**:

* Traditional similarity search returns the top `k` results based solely on cosine similarity.
* MMR ensures that the returned documents are not only **relevant** but also **not too similar to each other**.

This prevents **redundancy** and allows **coverage of multiple aspects** of the query.

### 🔍 MMR in Action

Imagine you're querying: `"company email policy"`

Using regular similarity:

* Result 1: "Email policy outlines appropriate use"
* Result 2: "Email policy defines what emails can be sent"
* Result 3: "Email policy is for internal communication only"

Using MMR:

* Result 1: "Email policy outlines appropriate use"
* Result 2: "Penalties for email misuse"
* Result 3: "Internal email archiving rules"

➡️ **MMR brings broader coverage** of the topic instead of repeating similar content.

### 📌 Enabling MMR in LangChain

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="mmr", search_kwargs={"k": 3})
```

---

## ✅ Summary

* A **LangChain retriever** is an interface for returning relevant documents given a free-text query.
* The **vector store-based retriever** works by comparing the embedding of the query with embedded chunks in a vector database.
* Two retrieval methods:

  * **Similarity search** – retrieves most similar chunks.
  * **MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance)** – retrieves a diverse and relevant set of chunks.
* LangChain provides a convenient `.as_retriever()` method to convert a vector store into a retriever.

2. Embed it and store in FAISS.
3. Convert to retriever.
4. Query with and without MMR.

## What is a Retriever?

A retriever is an interface that takes a **free-text query** → returns a list of relevant documents or chunks.

Retriever ≠ LLM response → it only *fetches documents*, which can later be passed to an LLM if needed.

# 🔍 Vector Store Retriever

**Simplest retriever.**

How it works:

1. Store documents as embeddings in vector DB (FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma)
2. Embed query
3. Return top-K similar chunks

Use when:

* You want basic keyword/semantic search

---

# 🔄 Multi-Query Retriever

### What It Does

LLM generates **multiple versions of your query** → retrieves for each → merges results.

### Why Use It?

* Embeddings can be sensitive to wording → this solves that.
* Query: "email policy" → LLM generates variations:

  * "rules for using email"
  * "company email guidelines"
  * "corporate communication policy"

### How It Works:

1. LLM takes your query → outputs N variations.
2. Each variation is run through base retriever.
3. Final results are union of all runs.

### Example:

```python
from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever

multi_query_retriever = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    llm=ChatOpenAI()
)
results = multi_query_retriever.get_relevant_documents("email policy")
```

---

# 🎭 Self-Query Retriever

### What It Does

Parses query → splits into **semantic query + metadata filter**.

### Why Use It?

* If your documents have metadata — year, author, rating — this allows **filtering**.
* Query: "Find movies directed by Nolan after 2015 with rating > 8.5"

### How It Works:

1. LLM parses query →

   * Semantic part
   * Metadata filter
2. Vector search + filter → accurate results

### Example:

```python
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    document_contents="Brief movie description",
    metadata_field_info=metadata_field_info
)

results = retriever.get_relevant_documents("movies rated above 8.5")
```

---

# 🏛️ Parent Document Retriever

### What It Does

Returns **whole section** instead of small chunks.

### Why Use It?

* You embedded small chunks for retrieval.
* But users want to read full section — not fragment.

### How It Works:

1. Parent splitter: big chunks
2. Child splitter: small embeddings
3. When user asks "smoking policy", retrieves **parent section**

### Example:

```python
retriever = ParentDocumentRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    docstore=parent_docstore,
    child_splitter=child_splitter,
    parent_splitter=parent_splitter
)
results = retriever.get_relevant_documents("smoking policy")
```

---

# ⏳ Time-Weighted Retriever

### What It Does

Prioritizes **recent documents**.

### Why Use It?

* Agents / Chatbots with recency → "What happened last week?"

### How It Works:

* Adds timestamp / decay factor → boosts recent docs.

### Example:

```python
retriever = TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    decay_rate=0.01,
    k=5
)
```

---

# 🗜️ Contextual Compression Retriever

### What It Does

Uses LLM to **compress** results.

### Why Use It?

* You hit token limit — want **shorter**, more informative documents.

### How It Works:

1. Retrieve docs
2. LLM compresses → summarizes → returns only needed info

### Example:

```python
retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    compressor=LLMCompressor(llm=ChatOpenAI())
)
```

---

# 🧬 Ensemble Retriever

### What It Does

Combines **multiple retrievers** (e.g. keyword + vector).

### Why Use It?

* Hybrid search often beats pure vector.

### How It Works:

* Runs each retriever
* Merges results

### Example:

```python
retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[vector_retriever, keyword_retriever],
    weights=[0.7, 0.3]
)
```
