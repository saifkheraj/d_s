        "Imagine you are working in a customer support center that receives a high volume of inquiries and tickets every day. Your task is to create a system that can quickly provide support agents with the most relevant information to resolve customer issues. Traditional methods of searching through FAQs or support documents can be slow and inefficient, leading to delayed responses and dissatisfied customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this challenge, you will use embedding models to convert support documents and past inquiry responses into numerical vectors that capture their semantic content. These vectors will be stored in a vector database, enabling fast and accurate similarity searches. For example, when a support agent receives a new inquiry about a product issue, the system can instantly retrieve similar past inquiries and their resolutions, helping the agent to provide a quicker and more accurate response.\n",

        "We will learn how to use vector databases to store embeddings generated from textual data using LangChain. The focus will be on two popular vector databases: Chroma DB and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search). You will also learn how to perform similarity searches in these databases based on a query, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information. By the end of this lab, you will be able to effectively use vector databases to store and query embeddings, enhancing your data analysis and retrieval capabilities.\n",
