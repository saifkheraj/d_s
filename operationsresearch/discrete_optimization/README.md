# 🧠 Understanding "Value per Weight" in the Knapsack Problem

## 📦 What is the Knapsack Problem?

The **Knapsack Problem** is a classic optimization challenge in computer science and operations research.  
Given a set of items, each with a **weight** and **value**, and a bag (knapsack) with a **maximum weight capacity**,  
the goal is to **maximize the total value of items selected** without exceeding the knapsack's weight limit.

## ⚖️ What is "Value per Weight"?

**Value per Weight** (also called **value density**) is a simple yet powerful metric used in greedy algorithms  
for the knapsack problem. It tells you **how much value an item gives you per unit of weight**.

### 🧮 Formula:

value_per_weight = value / weight

## 📊 Example

Imagine you have the following items:

| Item           | Value ($) | Weight (kg) | Value/Weight |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Gold Coin      | 100       | 2           | 50.0          |
| Bronze Statue  | 90        | 5           | 18.0          |
| Painting       | 60        | 1           | 60.0          |

If you're using a **greedy strategy based on value per weight**, you should pick the item with the **highest value density first**.  
In this case, the **Painting (60)** is the most efficient item per kg and would be selected first.

## 🤖 Why Use Value per Weight?

In greedy algorithms for the knapsack problem:

- Picking the **most valuable item** might give you less value if it’s too heavy.
- Picking the **lightest item** might not contribute enough value.
- But picking based on **value per weight** balances both, often leading to better solutions.

This strategy is fast and works well in many practical cases, even though it doesn't always guarantee the optimal result.

---

## 🚀 Summary

- **Value per Weight** = Value ÷ Weight
- Used in greedy algorithms to make efficient packing decisions.
- Helps choose items that give the **most value for the least weight**.
- A good **baseline approach** for solving knapsack-like problems quickly.

# 🎒 Modeling the Knapsack Problem – Discrete Optimization

This document explains how to **mathematically model the knapsack problem** using binary decision variables, constraints, and an objective function. This forms the basis for solving many real-world optimization problems efficiently.

## 📦 Problem Description

Given:
- A set of items `I = {1, 2, ..., n}`.
- Each item `i` has:
  - A **value** `v_i`
  - A **weight** `w_i`
- A **knapsack** with a weight capacity `W`.

### 🎯 Objective:
Select a subset of items to:
- **Maximize the total value**,
- Without exceeding the **total weight capacity** of the knapsack.

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Mathematical Modeling

### 1. ✅ Decision Variables

For each item `i`, define a binary variable:


x_i = 1 → item i is selected

x_i = 0 → item i is not selected


This represents the yes/no decision for each item.

---

### 2. 📏 Constraints

Ensure the **total weight** of selected items does not exceed the knapsack capacity `W`:

∑ (w_i * x_i) ≤ W


Only selected items (where `x_i = 1`) contribute to the total weight.

---

### 3. 📈 Objective Function

We want to **maximize the total value** of the selected items:


Maximize ∑ (v_i * x_i)



This tells us the "goodness" of any selection of items.

---

## 🧮 Final Optimization Model


Maximize: ∑ v_i * x_i
Subject to: ∑ w_i * x_i ≤ W
x_i ∈ {0, 1} for all i in I



This is a **0-1 Integer Linear Programming** (ILP) model.

---

## 🌌 Search Space and Feasibility

Each item has two possibilities: selected (1) or not (0).

- For `n` items, total possible combinations = `2^n`
- This set of all combinations is called the **search space**
- Only those combinations that satisfy the weight constraint are **feasible solutions**

### 🚫 Why Brute Force Fails

If it takes **1 millisecond** to check a single configuration:

- For 50 items → `2^50 ≈ 1.1 × 10^15` combinations
- Total time needed: **millions of centuries**

💡 Brute force is not feasible for large `n`.

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

To solve the problem efficiently for large instances, we use advanced techniques like:

- **Constraint Programming**
- **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**
- **Local Search**
- **Heuristics & Metaheuristics**

These methods help us:
- Find **optimal or near-optimal** solutions
- **Quickly**, even when the search space is massive
