## What is the Simplex Method?

The Simplex Method is an algorithm for solving **Linear Programming (LP)** problems:
- **Maximize** or **minimize** a linear objective function
- Subject to linear constraints (inequalities/equalities)
- All variables are non-negative

### Key Insight
The optimal solution to any LP problem always occurs at a **corner point** (vertex) of the feasible region. The Simplex Method efficiently walks from one corner to another, always improving the objective function, until no further improvement is possible.

## Prerequisites

- Basic linear algebra (systems of equations)
- Understanding of inequalities and graphing
- Familiarity with mathematical optimization concepts

## Key Concepts

### 1. Slack Variables
Convert inequality constraints (‚â§) into equalities by adding slack variables.

**Example:** `2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 4` becomes `2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÅ = 4` where `s‚ÇÅ ‚â• 0`

**Interpretation:** Slack represents "leftover room" in a constraint. When slack = 0, the constraint is tight (exactly satisfied).

### 2. Basis and Basic Variables

- **Basic Variables**: Variables currently in the solution (have positive values)
- **Non-Basic Variables**: Variables set to zero
- **Basis**: The set of basic variables at any iteration

The basis changes as we move from one corner point to another:
- One non-basic variable **enters** the basis (becomes > 0)
- One basic variable **leaves** the basis (becomes 0)

### 3. Tableau Structure

The simplex tableau organizes all information needed for the algorithm:

| Basis | x‚ÇÅ | x‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ | s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÉ | RHS |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| s‚ÇÅ    | 2  | -1 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 4   |
| s‚ÇÇ    | 2  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 8   |
| s‚ÇÉ    | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 3   |
| z     | -1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0   |

## Step-by-Step Example

### Problem Statement
```
Maximize: z = x‚ÇÅ

Subject to:
  2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 4
  2x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 8  
  x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 3
  x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ ‚â• 0
```

### Step 1: Add Slack Variables
```
Maximize: z = x‚ÇÅ

Subject to:
  2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÅ = 4
  2x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÇ = 8
  x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÉ = 3
  x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ ‚â• 0
```

**Initial Solution:** x‚ÇÅ = 0, x‚ÇÇ = 0, s‚ÇÅ = 4, s‚ÇÇ = 8, s‚ÇÉ = 3, z = 0  
**Initial Basis:** {s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}

## Visual Walkthrough

### Iteration 0 (Starting Point)
**Location:** (0, 0)  
**Basis:** {s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}  
**Objective:** z = 0

### Iteration 1
**Entering Variable:** x‚ÇÅ (most negative reduced cost: -1)  
**Leaving Variable:** s‚ÇÅ (ratio test: min{4/2, 8/2} = 2)  
**New Location:** (2, 0)  
**New Basis:** {x‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}  
**Objective:** z = 2

### Iteration 2 (Optimal)
**Entering Variable:** x‚ÇÇ (negative reduced cost: -0.5)  
**Leaving Variable:** s‚ÇÇ (ratio test: min{4/2, 3/1} = 2)  
**Final Location:** (3, 2)  
**Final Basis:** {x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}  
**Optimal Objective:** z = 3

## Understanding the Algorithm

### How to Choose the Entering Variable
Look at the **z-row** (bottom row) for **reduced costs**:
- **Negative reduced cost** ‚Üí Increasing this variable improves z
- **Zero reduced cost** ‚Üí No effect on z
- **Positive reduced cost** ‚Üí Would make z worse

Choose the variable with the **most negative** reduced cost.

### How to Choose the Leaving Variable (Ratio Test)
1. Look at the column of the entering variable
2. For each **positive** entry, calculate: `RHS √∑ column entry`
3. The row with the **smallest ratio** determines the leaving variable

**Why?** This variable will hit zero first as we increase the entering variable.

### When to Stop
The algorithm terminates when the z-row has **no negative reduced costs**. This means no variable can further improve the objective function.

## Common Questions

### Q: Why does the basis change?
**A:** As we move from one corner of the feasible region to another, different constraints become "tight" (active). This changes which variables are basic (positive) vs non-basic (zero).

### Q: What if there are multiple negative reduced costs?
**A:** Choose the most negative one. This is the steepest ascent rule and typically leads to faster convergence.

### Q: What does it mean geometrically when a variable enters/leaves?
**A:** We're moving along an edge of the feasible region polygon. The entering variable determines the direction, and the leaving variable determines how far we can go before hitting the next corner.

### Q: Can the algorithm fail?
**A:** The algorithm can encounter two special cases:
- **Unbounded solution**: The objective can be increased indefinitely
- **Degeneracy**: Multiple optimal solutions exist

## Algorithm Summary

1. **Setup**: Convert to standard form with slack variables
2. **Initialize**: Start at origin with all slacks basic
3. **Iterate**:
   - Choose entering variable (most negative reduced cost)
   - Choose leaving variable (ratio test)
   - Pivot to new basic solution
4. **Terminate**: When no negative reduced costs remain

# Simplex Method: Tableau vs Matrix Form

This document explains and compares the two main ways of implementing the Simplex method:

1. **Tableau Method** ‚Äî the traditional row-operations approach
2. **Matrix Method** ‚Äî the algebraic/linear algebra approach used in solvers

## Problem Setup (Example)

We want to solve:

**Maximize:**
```
z = x‚ÇÅ + 3x‚ÇÇ
```

**Subject to:**
```
-x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ ‚â§  3
-x‚ÇÅ + 2x‚ÇÇ ‚â§  8
 3x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 18
 x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ ‚â•  0
```

### Step 1: Standard Form

Add slack variables s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ:

```
-x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÅ      =  3
-x‚ÇÅ + 2x‚ÇÇ      + s‚ÇÇ =  8
 3x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ           + s‚ÇÉ = 18
```

**Variables:** (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ)

**Matrix form:**
```
     [-1   1   1   0   0]
A =  [-1   2   0   1   0]
     [ 3   1   0   0   1]

     [ 3]       [1]
b =  [ 8],  c = [3]
     [18]       [0]
                [0]
                [0]
```

## Tableau Method

### Initial Tableau

| Basis | x‚ÇÅ | x‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ | s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÉ | RHS |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| s‚ÇÅ    | -1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  3 |
| s‚ÇÇ    | -1 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  8 |
| s‚ÇÉ    |  3 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 | 18 |
| z     | -1 | -3 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |

### Process

1. **Entering variable:** Most negative in z row = **-3** ‚Üí x‚ÇÇ enters
2. **Leaving variable:** Ratio test ‚Üí min(3/1, 8/2, 18/1) = **3** ‚Üí s‚ÇÅ leaves
3. **Pivot:** Perform row operations to update tableau
4. **Repeat** until all reduced costs ‚â• 0

## Matrix Method

### Step 1: Split Basis/Nonbasis

- **Basis (initial):** s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ
- **Nonbasis:** x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ

So:
```
A_B = I‚ÇÉ (3√ó3 identity matrix) = [1  0  0]
                                 [0  1  0]
                                 [0  0  1]

A_N = [-1  1]     c_B = [0]     c_N = [1]
      [-1  2]           [0]           [3]
      [ 3  1]           [0]
```

### Step 2: Compute Basic Solution

```
x_B = A_B‚Åª¬π √ó b = I‚ÇÉ √ó b = b = [3]
                               [8]
                               [18]
```

Therefore: s‚ÇÅ = 3, s‚ÇÇ = 8, s‚ÇÉ = 18, x‚ÇÅ = 0, x‚ÇÇ = 0

### Step 3: Reduced Costs

```
r_N^T = c_N^T - c_B^T √ó A_B‚Åª¬π √ó A_N
      = [1  3] - [0  0  0] √ó [-1  1]
                              [-1  2]
                              [ 3  1]
      = [1  3] - [0  0] = [1  3]
```

In tableau convention ‚Üí (-1, -3). Since -3 < 0, variable x‚ÇÇ enters the basis.

### Step 4: Ratio Test

Direction vector for entering variable x‚ÇÇ:
```
d = A_B‚Åª¬π √ó A_x‚ÇÇ = I‚ÇÉ √ó [1] = [1]
                         [2]   [2]
                         [1]   [1]
```

Ratio test:
```
min{x_B·µ¢/d·µ¢ : d·µ¢ > 0} = min{3/1, 8/2, 18/1} = min{3, 4, 18} = 3
```

‚Üí s‚ÇÅ leaves the basis (first constraint becomes tight)

### Step 5: Update Basis

**New basis:** (x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ)

Update basis matrix:
```
A_B^new = [1  1  0]  (columns for x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ)
          [2  0  1]
          [1  0  0]
```

Compute new basic solution: x_B^new = (A_B^new)‚Åª¬π √ó b

Repeat until all reduced costs ‚â• 0.

## Comparison

| Aspect | Tableau Method | Matrix Method |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **What you do** | Pivot with row operations on a tableau | Compute x_B = A_B‚Åª¬π√ób, reduced costs, ratios |
| **Good for** | Learning, small problems, manual solving | Computer implementations, large LPs |
| **Pros** | Visual, intuitive, easy step tracking | Efficient, compact, avoids giant tableaux |
| **Cons** | Gets messy for large LPs | Requires linear algebra (inverses/factorizations) |

## Which Method to Use?

### üìö Learning/Exams ‚Üí Use **Tableau Method**
- Easy to understand entering/leaving variables
- Clear visualization of how pivots work  
- Step-by-step process is transparent
- Good for hand calculations

### üíª Coding/Real-World LP Solving ‚Üí Use **Matrix Method**
- All professional solvers (CPLEX, Gurobi, GLPK) use matrix-based implementations
- More efficient for large problems
- Better numerical stability control
- Easier to implement advanced techniques (dual simplex, primal-dual, etc.)

## Final Result

For this example:

**Optimal solution:**
```
x‚ÇÅ* = 2
x‚ÇÇ* = 5  
z*  = 17
```

**Solution path:**
```
(x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ): (0,0) ‚Üí (0,3) ‚Üí (2,5)
```

**Verification:**
```
z* = 1√ó2 + 3√ó5 = 2 + 15 = 17 ‚úì

Constraint check:
-2 + 5  =  3 ‚â§  3 ‚úì
-2 + 10 =  8 ‚â§  8 ‚úì  
 6 + 5  = 11 ‚â§ 18 ‚úì
```

        tableau[leaving_row] /= pivot_element
