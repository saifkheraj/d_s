## What is the Simplex Method?

The Simplex Method is an algorithm for solving **Linear Programming (LP)** problems:
- **Maximize** or **minimize** a linear objective function
- Subject to linear constraints (inequalities/equalities)
- All variables are non-negative

### Key Insight
The optimal solution to any LP problem always occurs at a **corner point** (vertex) of the feasible region. The Simplex Method efficiently walks from one corner to another, always improving the objective function, until no further improvement is possible.

## Prerequisites

- Basic linear algebra (systems of equations)
- Understanding of inequalities and graphing
- Familiarity with mathematical optimization concepts

## Key Concepts

### 1. Slack Variables
Convert inequality constraints (‚â§) into equalities by adding slack variables.

**Example:** `2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 4` becomes `2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÅ = 4` where `s‚ÇÅ ‚â• 0`

**Interpretation:** Slack represents "leftover room" in a constraint. When slack = 0, the constraint is tight (exactly satisfied).

### 2. Basis and Basic Variables

- **Basic Variables**: Variables currently in the solution (have positive values)
- **Non-Basic Variables**: Variables set to zero
- **Basis**: The set of basic variables at any iteration

The basis changes as we move from one corner point to another:
- One non-basic variable **enters** the basis (becomes > 0)
- One basic variable **leaves** the basis (becomes 0)

### 3. Tableau Structure

The simplex tableau organizes all information needed for the algorithm:

| Basis | x‚ÇÅ | x‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ | s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÉ | RHS |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| s‚ÇÅ    | 2  | -1 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 4   |
| s‚ÇÇ    | 2  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 8   |
| s‚ÇÉ    | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 3   |
| z     | -1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0   |

## Step-by-Step Example

### Problem Statement
```
Maximize: z = x‚ÇÅ

Subject to:
  2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 4
  2x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 8  
  x‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 3
  x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ ‚â• 0
```

### Step 1: Add Slack Variables
```
Maximize: z = x‚ÇÅ

Subject to:
  2x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÅ = 4
  2x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÇ = 8
  x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÉ = 3
  x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ ‚â• 0
```

**Initial Solution:** x‚ÇÅ = 0, x‚ÇÇ = 0, s‚ÇÅ = 4, s‚ÇÇ = 8, s‚ÇÉ = 3, z = 0  
**Initial Basis:** {s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}

## Visual Walkthrough

### Iteration 0 (Starting Point)
**Location:** (0, 0)  
**Basis:** {s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}  
**Objective:** z = 0

### Iteration 1
**Entering Variable:** x‚ÇÅ (most negative reduced cost: -1)  
**Leaving Variable:** s‚ÇÅ (ratio test: min{4/2, 8/2} = 2)  
**New Location:** (2, 0)  
**New Basis:** {x‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}  
**Objective:** z = 2

### Iteration 2 (Optimal)
**Entering Variable:** x‚ÇÇ (negative reduced cost: -0.5)  
**Leaving Variable:** s‚ÇÇ (ratio test: min{4/2, 3/1} = 2)  
**Final Location:** (3, 2)  
**Final Basis:** {x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ}  
**Optimal Objective:** z = 3

## Understanding the Algorithm

### How to Choose the Entering Variable
Look at the **z-row** (bottom row) for **reduced costs**:
- **Negative reduced cost** ‚Üí Increasing this variable improves z
- **Zero reduced cost** ‚Üí No effect on z
- **Positive reduced cost** ‚Üí Would make z worse

Choose the variable with the **most negative** reduced cost.

### How to Choose the Leaving Variable (Ratio Test)
1. Look at the column of the entering variable
2. For each **positive** entry, calculate: `RHS √∑ column entry`
3. The row with the **smallest ratio** determines the leaving variable

**Why?** This variable will hit zero first as we increase the entering variable.

### When to Stop
The algorithm terminates when the z-row has **no negative reduced costs**. This means no variable can further improve the objective function.

## Common Questions

### Q: Why does the basis change?
**A:** As we move from one corner of the feasible region to another, different constraints become "tight" (active). This changes which variables are basic (positive) vs non-basic (zero).

### Q: What if there are multiple negative reduced costs?
**A:** Choose the most negative one. This is the steepest ascent rule and typically leads to faster convergence.

### Q: What does it mean geometrically when a variable enters/leaves?
**A:** We're moving along an edge of the feasible region polygon. The entering variable determines the direction, and the leaving variable determines how far we can go before hitting the next corner.

### Q: Can the algorithm fail?
**A:** The algorithm can encounter two special cases:
- **Unbounded solution**: The objective can be increased indefinitely
- **Degeneracy**: Multiple optimal solutions exist

## Algorithm Summary

1. **Setup**: Convert to standard form with slack variables
2. **Initialize**: Start at origin with all slacks basic
3. **Iterate**:
   - Choose entering variable (most negative reduced cost)
   - Choose leaving variable (ratio test)
   - Pivot to new basic solution
4. **Terminate**: When no negative reduced costs remain

# Simplex Method: Tableau vs Matrix Form

This document explains and compares the two main ways of implementing the Simplex method:

1. **Tableau Method** ‚Äî the traditional row-operations approach
2. **Matrix Method** ‚Äî the algebraic/linear algebra approach used in solvers

## Problem Setup (Example)

We want to solve this Linear Programming problem:

**Maximize:** `z = x‚ÇÅ + 3x‚ÇÇ`

**Subject to:**
```
-x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ  ‚â§   3
-x‚ÇÅ + 2x‚ÇÇ  ‚â§   8  
 3x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ  ‚â§  18
 x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ    ‚â•   0
```

## Step 1: Convert to Standard Form

Add slack variables s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ to convert inequalities to equalities:

```
-x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÅ + 0s‚ÇÇ + 0s‚ÇÉ =  3
-x‚ÇÅ + 2x‚ÇÇ + 0s‚ÇÅ + s‚ÇÇ + 0s‚ÇÉ =  8
 3x‚ÇÅ +  x‚ÇÇ + 0s‚ÇÅ + 0s‚ÇÇ + s‚ÇÉ = 18
```

**All variables:** x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ ‚â• 0

**In matrix notation:**

**Matrix A** (constraint coefficients):
```
        x‚ÇÅ  x‚ÇÇ  s‚ÇÅ  s‚ÇÇ  s‚ÇÉ
Row 1  [-1   1   1   0   0]
Row 2  [-1   2   0   1   0]  
Row 3  [ 3   1   0   0   1]
```

**Vector b** (right-hand side):
```
b = [ 3]
    [ 8]
    [18]
```

**Vector c** (objective coefficients):
```
c = [ 1]  ‚Üê coefficient of x‚ÇÅ
    [ 3]  ‚Üê coefficient of x‚ÇÇ  
    [ 0]  ‚Üê coefficient of s‚ÇÅ
    [ 0]  ‚Üê coefficient of s‚ÇÇ
    [ 0]  ‚Üê coefficient of s‚ÇÉ
```

## Method 1: Tableau Method üìä

### Initial Tableau

| Basic Var | x‚ÇÅ | x‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÅ | s‚ÇÇ | s‚ÇÉ | RHS |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| s‚ÇÅ        | -1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  3 |
| s‚ÇÇ        | -1 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  8 |
| s‚ÇÉ        |  3 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 | 18 |
| **z-row** | -1 | -3 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |

### How Tableau Method Works:

**Step 1: Find Entering Variable**
- Look at z-row for most negative number
- Most negative = -3 (under x‚ÇÇ column)
- **x‚ÇÇ enters the basis**

**Step 2: Find Leaving Variable (Ratio Test)**
- For x‚ÇÇ column, calculate: RHS √∑ positive coefficients
- Row 1: 3 √∑ 1 = 3
- Row 2: 8 √∑ 2 = 4  
- Row 3: 18 √∑ 1 = 18
- Minimum ratio = 3 ‚Üí **s‚ÇÅ leaves the basis**

**Step 3: Pivot Operation**
- Pivot element = 1 (intersection of x‚ÇÇ column and s‚ÇÅ row)
- Use row operations to make this element = 1 and others in column = 0
- Continue until no negative numbers in z-row

## Method 2: Matrix Method üî¢

The matrix method splits variables into two groups:

### Step 1: Identify Basic and Non-basic Variables

**Initial Setup:**
- **Basic variables** (in the solution): s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ
- **Non-basic variables** (set to zero): x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ

### Step 2: Split the Constraint Matrix

**A_B** (Basic variables part - columns for s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ):
```
A_B = [1  0  0]  ‚Üê This is a 3√ó3 identity matrix
      [0  1  0]
      [0  0  1]
```

**A_N** (Non-basic variables part - columns for x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ):
```
A_N = [-1   1]  ‚Üê Column 1: x‚ÇÅ coefficients  
      [-1   2]  ‚Üê Column 2: x‚ÇÇ coefficients
      [ 3   1]
```

**c_B** (costs of basic variables):
```
c_B = [0]  ‚Üê cost of s‚ÇÅ
      [0]  ‚Üê cost of s‚ÇÇ  
      [0]  ‚Üê cost of s‚ÇÉ
```

**c_N** (costs of non-basic variables):
```
c_N = [1]  ‚Üê cost of x‚ÇÅ
      [3]  ‚Üê cost of x‚ÇÇ
```

### Step 3: Solve for Basic Variables

Since A_B is identity matrix: **x_B = A_B‚Åª¬π √ó b = b**

**Current solution:**
```
s‚ÇÅ = 3   (basic)
s‚ÇÇ = 8   (basic)  
s‚ÇÉ = 18  (basic)
x‚ÇÅ = 0   (non-basic)
x‚ÇÇ = 0   (non-basic)
```

### Step 4: Check if Optimal (Reduced Costs)

**Formula:** `reduced_costs = c_N - c_B^T √ó A_B‚Åª¬π √ó A_N`

**Calculation:**
```
c_N = [1, 3]
c_B^T √ó A_B‚Åª¬π √ó A_N = [0, 0, 0] √ó [1 0 0] √ó [-1  1] = [0, 0]
                                    [0 1 0]   [-1  2]
                                    [0 0 1]   [ 3  1]

reduced_costs = [1, 3] - [0, 0] = [1, 3]
```

**Interpretation:** 
- For tableau: we use negative of these ‚Üí [-1, -3]
- Since -3 < 0, **x‚ÇÇ should enter** (can improve objective)

### Step 5: Find Leaving Variable

**Direction vector** (what happens when x‚ÇÇ enters):
```
d = A_B‚Åª¬π √ó (x‚ÇÇ column from A_N) = [1 0 0] √ó [1] = [1]
                                   [0 1 0]   [2]   [2]
                                   [0 0 1]   [1]   [1]
```

**Ratio test:**
```
Current basic values: [3, 8, 18]
Direction vector:     [1, 2,  1]
Ratios:              [3/1, 8/2, 18/1] = [3, 4, 18]
```

**Minimum ratio = 3 ‚Üí s‚ÇÅ leaves**

### Step 6: Update Basis and Repeat

**New basic variables:** x‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ  
**New non-basic variables:** x‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÅ

Repeat steps 2-5 until all reduced costs ‚â• 0.

## Final Answer for Our Example

Both methods give the same result:

**Optimal Solution:**
```
x‚ÇÅ = 2
x‚ÇÇ = 5
Maximum z = 1(2) + 3(5) = 17
```

**Verification (check all constraints):**
```
Constraint 1: -2 + 5 = 3 ‚â§ 3 ‚úÖ
Constraint 2: -2 + 10 = 8 ‚â§ 8 ‚úÖ  
Constraint 3: 6 + 5 = 11 ‚â§ 18 ‚úÖ
```

**Path taken:**
```
Start: (0,0) with z = 0
Step 1: (0,3) with z = 9  
Step 2: (2,5) with z = 17 ‚Üê OPTIMAL
```
